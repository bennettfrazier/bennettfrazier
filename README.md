### Hello!

I love data visualization, design, branding, marketing, and budgeting.

Currently I work at [utiliVisor](https://www.utilivisor.com/) as the Marketing Director, managing the website, marketing, & design. I also am helping build out our next-gen of our web apps, tools, and mobile applications.

Formerly I worked at [Crescendo Collective](https://www.crescendocollective.com/) as a Senior Frontend Developer working on a variety of websites, web apps, and CMS platforms. I also ran my own branding company, [Designnn](https://designnn.co/) from 2020 - 2022.
